## ✨ Key Features

- **🎭 High-Fidelity VRM Integration**: Supports full VRM character models with spring-bone physics, facial expressions, and high-quality textures.
- **🗣️ Real-time Lip-Sync & Speech**: Integrated speech recognition and procedural lip-syncing for realistic conversations.
- **🕹️ Immersive 3D HUD**: A premium, responsive interface featuring modules for Care, Wellness, Device Management, and Scheduling.
- **🎵 Spotify Neural Link**: Seamlessly connect and control your Spotify playback with real-time mood-based interactions.
- **🌌 Dynamic Environments**: Fully customizable 3D environments with starry backgrounds and reactive lighting.
- **🧠 Advanced State Management**: Powered by Zustand and Firebase for lightning-fast responsiveness and data persistence.

## 🛠️ How the System Works

Maeve AI is built on a modern, distributed architecture designed for low-latency interactions and high visual quality.

### 1. Rendering Engine (Frontend)
The core of Maeve is built using **React 19** and **Three.js** (via **React Three Fiber**). This allows for a declarative 3D scene where the character and UI coexist in a unified space.
- **VRM Controller**: Uses `@pixiv/three-vrm` to handle character animations, gaze tracking (following your mouse), and blend-shape expressions.
- **HUD Layer**: A high-performance overlay built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions and glassmorphism effects.

### 2. AI Intelligence (Backend)
The brain of Maeve is a high-performance Python backend that handles complex AI tasks.
- **Vision & Emotion**: Integrated vision services for real-time environment awareness and emotion detection.
- **Neural TTS**: Sophisticated Text-to-Speech engine using Kokoro and ONNX for natural, expressive voice synthesis.
- **Proactive Initiative**: An autonomous engine that allows Maeve to take initiative and start conversations based on user context.

### 3. Interaction & Logic
- **Socket Bridge**: A WebSocket-based worker bridge handles real-time data flow between the AI brain and the 3D representation.
- **Mood System**: A sophisticated state machine that tracks Maeve's "mood," influencing her animations, speech patterns, and even the UI vibe.
- **Neural Links**: Direct integrations with services like Spotify to create a holistic assistant experience.
